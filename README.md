The **Zoom SDK** for Android allows developers to integrate Zoom's video conferencing, chat, and webinar functionalities directly into their Android apps. This enables users to host or join Zoom meetings without leaving the app, providing a seamless experience.

### Features of Zoom Android SDK:
1. **Video and Audio Conferencing**: Allows users to join or host video meetings with real-time audio and video features.
2. **Webinars**: Supports integration of Zoom Webinars where large audiences can join.
3. **Screen Sharing**: Users can share their mobile screen with others in a meeting.
4. **In-Meeting Chat**: Text chat is available for participants during a Zoom meeting.
5. **Meeting Controls**: Provides controls for managing participants, muting/unmuting, recording meetings, and more.
6. **Authentication**: Options for meeting authentication, including SSO, OAuth, or JWT token-based authentication.
7. **Custom UI**: Ability to customize the UI to match the branding or design of your app, offering a more tailored user experience.

### Steps to Integrate Zoom SDK in an Android App:

1. **Sign Up for Zoom Developer Account**:
   - To access the SDK, you need a Zoom Developer account. Sign up at [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/).

2. **Create a Zoom SDK App**:
   - Go to the Zoom Marketplace and create a new SDK app to get the necessary credentials (SDK Key and Secret).

3. **Download the Zoom SDK**:
   - Download the Zoom Android SDK from [Zoom's GitHub repository](https://github.com/zoom/zoom-sdk-android) or from the Zoom Marketplace.

4. **Add SDK to Your Project**:
   - Add the Zoom SDK `.aar` files or use the Maven dependency to your project.
   - Modify your `build.gradle` as follows:

   ```groovy
   repositories {
       mavenCentral()
       google()
   }

   dependencies {
       implementation 'us.zoom.sdk:zoom-sdk-android:5.7.1.1267' // Example version
   }
   ```

5. **Initialize the SDK**:
   - Before using the SDK, initialize it in your `Application` class or `MainActivity` using your SDK Key and Secret:

   ```java
   ZoomSDK sdk = ZoomSDK.getInstance();
   ZoomSDKInitParams initParams = new ZoomSDKInitParams();
   initParams.appKey = "YOUR_ZOOM_SDK_KEY";
   initParams.appSecret = "YOUR_ZOOM_SDK_SECRET";
   initParams.domain = "zoom.us";
   sdk.initialize(context, new ZoomSDKInitializeListener() {
       @Override
       public void onZoomSDKInitializeResult(int errorCode, int internalErrorCode) {
           if (errorCode == ZoomError.ZOOM_ERROR_SUCCESS) {
               // Initialization success
           } else {
               // Initialization failed
           }
       }

       @Override
       public void onZoomAuthIdentityExpired() {
           // Handle token expiration
       }
   }, initParams);
   ```

6. **Join or Start a Meeting**:
   - You can now create functionality to join or start a meeting. Here's an example to join a meeting:

   ```java
   ZoomSDK zoomSDK = ZoomSDK.getInstance();
   if (!zoomSDK.isInitialized()) {
       // Ensure SDK is initialized
       return;
   }

   ZoomSDKMeetingService meetingService = zoomSDK.getMeetingService();
   JoinMeetingParams params = new JoinMeetingParams();
   params.meetingNo = "MEETING_NUMBER";
   params.displayName = "USERNAME";
   params.password = "PASSWORD"; // Optional, if the meeting has a password
   meetingService.joinMeetingWithParams(context, params, options);
   ```

7. **Customizing UI**:
   - If you want to customize the UI, the Zoom SDK provides an option for a **Custom Meeting UI**. You can take full control of how the meeting interface looks by overriding the default UI components.

### Zoom SDK Authentication:
There are multiple ways to authenticate users with Zoom SDK:
- **JWT Authentication**: You can use a JWT token to authenticate users, which is especially useful for server-to-server communication.
- **OAuth**: OAuth-based authentication can be used for allowing users to log in with their Zoom account.
- **API Key/Secret**: The basic approach involves using the API Key and Secret associated with your Zoom SDK app.

### Best Practices:
- **Check for Updates**: Ensure your app uses the latest version of the SDK to avoid issues with API deprecations and to get new features.
- **Handle Permissions**: Make sure to handle runtime permissions (e.g., camera, microphone, etc.) properly.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Test the integration in different network conditions to ensure a smooth user experience.

### Zoom SDK Documentation:
For detailed information, you can visit the official documentation at [Zoom SDK Android Documentation](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/sdk/native-sdks/android).

By integrating the Zoom SDK, your app can provide a more engaging and interactive experience, leveraging Zoom's video conferencing capabilities.
